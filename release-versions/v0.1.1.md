# v0.1.1 Patch Release (2026-02-01) 🐞

This is a patch release addressing a critical bug in the Deep Learning module and updating documentation.

### 🛠️ Fixes
- **Deep Learning Models**: Fixed an `IndexError` in the `predict()` method for LSTM, GRU, CNN-LSTM, Transformer, and Ensemble models caused by incorrect data slicing logic.
- **Demo Notebook**: Updated `examples/notebooks/finlearner_demo.ipynb` to correct API usage, improve plotting with aligned axes, and include MAE metrics.
