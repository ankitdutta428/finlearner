# v0.1.2 Feature Release (2026-02-03)

This release adds real options chain data support, enhances backtesting capabilities with multiple deep learning models, and improves dependency management for CI compatibility.

## New Features

### Options Chain Data Fetching

Added `DataLoader.download_options_chain()` method to fetch real-time options data from Yahoo Finance:

```python
from finlearner import DataLoader

chain = DataLoader.download_options_chain('AAPL')
calls = chain['calls']       # DataFrame with call options
puts = chain['puts']         # DataFrame with put options
spot = chain['underlying_price']
expirations = chain['available_expirations']
```

The options chain includes bid/ask prices, strike prices, implied volatility, volume, and open interest for all available contracts.

### Enhanced Comprehensive Backtest Example

Updated `examples/examples-python/10_comprehensive_backtest.py` to:

- Load real market data from Yahoo Finance (TCS.NS)
- Test all available deep learning models:
  - LSTM (TimeSeriesPredictor)
  - GRU (GRUPredictor)
  - CNN-LSTM Hybrid (CNNLSTMPredictor)
  - Transformer with Self-Attention (TransformerPredictor)
- Compare model performance with a results table showing returns, Sharpe ratios, and max drawdown
- Include Golden Cross custom strategy for baseline comparison

### Real Options Backtest Example

Updated `examples/examples-python/11_options_backtest.py` to:

- Fetch live options chain data instead of synthetic prices
- Analyze ATM options with real market bid/ask spreads
- Compare market prices vs theoretical model prices (Black-Scholes, Binomial Tree)
- Demonstrate Bull Call Spread strategy with Greeks calculation

---

## Fixes

### Optional Dependencies

- Made `torch` and `transformers` imports optional in `finlearner/models.py`
- Prevents `ModuleNotFoundError` in environments without PyTorch installed
- Core models (LSTM, GRU, CNN-LSTM, Transformer) now only require TensorFlow
- Advanced models (TFT, N-BEATS) gracefully indicate when PyTorch is required

---

## Notes

- Options chain data from Yahoo Finance provides current snapshots only, not historical data
- For historical options backtesting, paid data sources (CBOE, Polygon.io) are recommended
- Indian market stocks (NSE) may not have options data available on Yahoo Finance
